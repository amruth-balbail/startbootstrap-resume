                        | I’m deeply passionate about quality assurance and genuinely enjoy exploring, testing, and refining software to make it more reliable and user-friendly. I approach QA with curiosity and care, always looking for ways to improve how testing supports the bigger picture. For me, it’s not just about finding bugs but about building confidence in every release, collaborating closely with teams, and making sure the end user has the best possible experience. Quality is something I advocate for throughout the entire development process.
